# ESP32-FingersUP
IoT-controlled LEDs with ESP32 using OpenCV and Gesture Recognition through a Camera

**Project Description:**

This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to control LEDs connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) by analyzing hand gestures captured via a camera and processed with the OpenCV library.

**Requirements:**

1. ESP32-based microcontroller (e.g., NodeMCU)
2. Camera module (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera or your pc camera)
3. OpenCV library
4. WiFi connectivity
5. LEDs and suitable resistors
6. Power supply

**Step-by-Step Project Development:**

1. **Hardware Assembly:**

   - Create a circuit to connect the ESP32 and LEDs. For example, you can connect each LED to a GPIO pin.
   - Connect the camera module to the ESP32 and provide the necessary power supply.

2. **ESP32 Programming:**
- Write a program for the ESP32 using an Arduino-compatible environment like Arduino IDE or PlatformIO. This program should establish a WiFi connection and control the LEDs using IoT protocols such as MQTT or HTTP.

3. **Camera Integration:**
- Set up the camera module to communicate with the ESP32. You may use communication protocols like SPI or I2C. But Ä± used my laptop webcam with wifi

4. **Using OpenCV:**
- Compile and install the OpenCV library for the ESP32.
- Capture video feed from the camera and process it using OpenCV. Utilize OpenCV's image processing capabilities to detect hand gestures.

5. **Gesture Recognition:**

- Develop an algorithm to recognize hand gestures using OpenCV. For example, you can employ a color-based tracking algorithm to detect your hand, or track its movement.

7. **LED Control:**
- When hand gestures are detected, send commands to the ESP32 to turn the LEDs on or off. You can achieve this using MQTT or HTTP protocols.

8. **User Interface (Optional):**
- Create a mobile app or web interface to allow users to remotely control the LEDs. This interface can send commands to the ESP32 based on user interactions.

9. **Testing and Fine-tuning:**
- Test the project and optimize it by adjusting the algorithm and making necessary corrections.

10. **Conclusion:**
- With the completed project, you'll be able to control IoT-connected LEDs through hand gestures, such as showing or moving your hand, triggering IoT functions like turning on or off the LEDs.

11. **Expanding and Enhancing the Project:**
- There are numerous opportunities to expand and enhance this project. You can add different LED effects for various hand gestures or integrate your project into a more complex IoT network.
- Additionally, don't forget to update the WiFi name, WiFi password, and subscriber name in Arduino. The subscriber name must remain the same.
