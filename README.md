# ESP8266-FingersUP
IoT-controlled LEDs with ESP8266 using OpenCV and Gesture Recognition through a Camera

**Project Description:**

This project utilizes an ESP8266 microcontroller to control LEDs connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) by analyzing hand gestures captured via a camera and processed with the OpenCV library.

**Requirements:**

1. ESP8266-based microcontroller (e.g., NodeMCU)
2. Camera module (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera or your pc camera)
3. OpenCV library
4. WiFi connectivity
5. LEDs and suitable resistors
6. Power supply

**Step-by-Step Project Development:**

1. **Hardware Assembly:**
   - Create a circuit to connect the ESP8266 and LEDs. For example, you can connect each LED to a GPIO pin.
   - Connect the camera module to the ESP8266 and provide the necessary power supply.

2. **ESP8266 Programming:**
   - Write a program for the ESP8266 using an Arduino-compatible environment like Arduino IDE or PlatformIO. This program should establish a WiFi connection and control the LEDs using IoT protocols such as MQTT or HTTP.

3. **Camera Integration:**
   - Set up the camera module to communicate with the ESP8266. You may use communication protocols like SPI or I2C. But Ä± used my laptop webcam with wifi

4. **Using OpenCV:**
   - Compile and install the OpenCV library for the ESP8266.
   - Capture video feed from the camera and process it using OpenCV. Utilize OpenCV's image processing capabilities to detect hand gestures.

5. **Gesture Recognition:**
   - Develop an algorithm to recognize hand gestures using OpenCV. For example, you can employ a color-based tracking algorithm to detect your hand, or track its movement.

6. **LED Control:**
   - When hand gestures are detected, send commands to the ESP8266 to turn the LEDs on or off. You can achieve this using MQTT or HTTP protocols.

7. **User Interface (Optional):**
   - Create a mobile app or web interface to allow users to remotely control the LEDs. This interface can send commands to the ESP8266 based on user interactions.

8. **Testing and Fine-tuning:**
   - Test the project and optimize it by adjusting the algorithm and making necessary corrections.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - With the completed project, you'll be able to control IoT-connected LEDs through hand gestures, such as showing or moving your hand, triggering IoT functions like turning on or off the LEDs.

There are plenty of opportunities to enhance and expand this project. You could add different LED effects for various hand gestures or integrate your project into a more complex IoT network.
